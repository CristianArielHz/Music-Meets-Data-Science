# Music-Meets-Data-Science

Hi, welcome to **MMDS**! The place where music meets data science.

If you are a beginning developer or you just would like to learn data science or create applications about music, you can download this repository to use and play with this data.

## Dataset 
For collecting data we are going to get the information from Wikipedia using web scraping with soup library in a jupyter notebook. 


## API 
We must create different services with Django Rest Framework for interacting the data. Also we must define the schema.

# App
For interacting the data we must create a flask app.
